    - Create a Rough Outline
        - Introduction
            - Say something interesting/contentious

                Global warming is a clear & present danger to all life on earth. Global warming
                is destroying many biospheres as we speak. For some species - including polar
                bears - extinction is imminent. We are the most significant contributor to
                global warming.

            - Global Warming is inevitable

                Global Warming is inevitable, and we have missed our largest chance to do anything
                about it. This is due to our inaction and doubts. Some people also take
                advantage of global warming.

            - We are speeding it up

                We have steadily increased global warming through greenhouse gasses
                & deforestation. We are creating a world where the atmosphere will be dangerous
                for all life.

            - There are consequences
                
        - Main Idea 1
        "What is global warming"
            - the science of global warming
                - Greenhouse gasses
                    Global Warming is the rise of average temperature around the globe. Global
                    warming is caused mainly by Greenhouse gases. The Greenhouse effect is caused
                    by the absorption & emission of infrared rays, these affect the surface
                    temperature of the planet.

        - Main Idea 2
        "The dangers of global warming"
            - Weird climate effects
                - Floods
                - Sinkholes
                - Intense heat waves
                - The economic effect
                - Famine
            - The danger to the developing world
                - Less wealth, less cushion
            - The dangers of global warming disbelief or/and inaction
            - How vocal minorities danger us all
            - Heats effect on decision making and crime.
            - Biodiversity
                - Deforestation
                - Heat
            - Long term dangers
                - Including permanent biosphere change, making earth uninhabitable to humans
                - Death of most animals
        - Main Idea 3
        "The Consequences of global warming, perhaps?"
            - Famine
                - Due to decreased world food production
            - Death from heat
                - Heat increase
            - Water
                - Heat evaporation
                - Over-use
        - Main Idea 4
        "What we can do to slow down global warming"
            - Clean energy use
            - Eat less meat 75%
            - Recycle
            - Energy efficient light bulbs
            - Less fracking
            - Long term
                - Artificial Biosphere
                - Migration to another planet
                - Artificial genetic mutation
                - Genocide
                - Terraforming
        - Conclusion
            - Global warming is a danger to all
            - There are consequences to global warming
            - WE can all do something to try and fix it
            - Good ending sentence; maybe
                - Death is inevitable, but we choose how we die
                - We choose what we 
- Climate Change: Sources
    - http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/mar/22/global-warming-hit-asia-hardest
        "Theses of this article is that global warming will hit everyone, but
        asia the hardest."

 - Supporting evidence
      - UN article
        - This source was relevant to them due to it's warnings of asia's specific vulnerabilities including heat stress, extreme precipitation, drought, and water scarcity.
        - Another reason this source was relevant is due to it's warnings of general global climate change risks including greater likelihood of injury, under-nutrition, and more deaths due to fires & heatwaves
        - Other potential risks include food shortages of 12% or more

  - http://blog.ucsusa.org/ocean-cooling-effect-global-warming-459
    "This article believes that the ocean is a temporary "speed bump", or air conditioner, slowing down global warming."
    - Supporting evidence
      - This article uses http://www.wunderground.com/news/no-hiatus-pause-global-warming-climate-change-heres-why-20140109 and https://www.sciencenews.org/article/global-warming-hiatus-tied-cooler-temps-pacific to support colder than general water temeratures
    - Relevance
      - This article is refutes the common theme that global warming is not happening, but instead that the ocean's uncommon "cold" (specifically the pacific) is acting as a buffer, or temporary temperature relief.
  - http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/apr/01/exxon-mobil-climate-change-fossil-fuels-oil
    - Supporting evidence
      - This article uses an exxon report on global climate change, and also uses the ipcc annual report on global climate change.
