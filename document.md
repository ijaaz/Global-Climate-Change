# Climate Change: #Project

- Climate Change: Paper
  - Create a Rough Outline
    - Introduction
      - Say something interesting/contentious
      - Global Warming is inevitable
      - Global warming is natural
      - We are speeding it up
      - There are consequences
    - Main Idea 1
      "What is global warming"
      - the science of global warming
        - Greenhouse gasses
        - Deforestation
      - Different global climate change models
      - A graph
    - Main Idea 2
      "The dangers of global warming"
      - Weird climate effects
        - Floods
        - Sinkholes
        - Intense heat waves
      - The economic effect
        - Famine
      - The danger to the developing world
        - Less wealth, less cushion
      - The dangers of global warming disbelief or/and inaction
        - How vocal minorities danger us all
      - Heats effect on decision making and crime.
      - Biodiversity
        - Deforestation
        - Heat
      - Long term dangers
        - Including permanent biosphere change, making earth uninhabitable to humans
        - Death of most animals
    - Main Idea 3
      "The Consequences of global warming, perhaps?"
      - Famine
        - Due to decreased world food production
      - Death from heat
        - Heat increase
      - Water
        - Heat evaporation
        - Over-use
    - Main Idea 4
      "What we can do to slow down global warming"
      - Clean energy use
      - Eat less meat 75%
      - Recycle
      - Energy efficient light bulbs
      - Less fracking
      - Long term
        - Artificial Biosphere
        - Migration to another planet
        - Artificial genetic mutation
        - Genocide
        - Terraforming
    - Conclusion
      - Global warming is a danger to all
      - There are consequences to global warming
      - WE can all do something to try and fix it
      - Good ending sentence; maybe
        - Death is inevitable, even the death of a planet, but we choose how we die, either in ignominy, or in the light of good decisions.
        - We choose what we 
- Climate Change: Sources
  - http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/mar/22/global-warming-hit-asia-hardest
    "Theses of this article is that global warming will hit everyone, but asia the hardest.
    "
    - Supporting evidence
      - UN article
        - This source was relevant to them due to it's warnings of asia's specific vulnerabilities including heat stress, extreme precipitation, drought, and water scarcity.
        - Another reason this source was relevant is due to it's warnings of general global climate change risks including greater likelihood of injury, under-nutrition, and more deaths due to fires & heatwaves
        - Other potential risks include food shortages of 12% or more

  - http://blog.ucsusa.org/ocean-cooling-effect-global-warming-459
    "This article believes that the ocean is a temporary "speed bump", or air conditioner, slowing down global warming."
    - Supporting evidence
      - This article uses http://www.wunderground.com/news/no-hiatus-pause-global-warming-climate-change-heres-why-20140109 and https://www.sciencenews.org/article/global-warming-hiatus-tied-cooler-temps-pacific to support colder than general water temeratures
    - Relevance
      - This article is refutes the common theme that global warming is not happening, but instead that the ocean's uncommon "cold" (specifically the pacific) is acting as a buffer, or temporary temperature relief.
  - http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/apr/01/exxon-mobil-climate-change-fossil-fuels-oil
    - Supporting evidence
      - This article uses an exxon report on global climate change, and also uses the ipcc annual report on global climate change.
    - Relevance
