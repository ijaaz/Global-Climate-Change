## Introduction

Global warming is a clear & present danger to all life on earth. Global warming
is destroying a many biospheres as we speak. For some species - including polar
bears - extinction is imminent. We are the most significant contributor to
global warming.

Global Warming is inevitable, we have missed are largest chance to do anything
about it. This is due to our inaction and doubts. Some people also take
advantage of global warming.

We have steadily increased global warming through greenhouse gasses
& deforestation. We are creating a world where the atmosphere will be dangerous
for all life.


## What is Global Warming?

Global Warming is the rise of average temperature around the globe. Global
warming is caused mainly by Greenhouse gases. The Greenhouse effect is caused
by the absorption & emission of infrared rays, these affect the surface
temperature of the planet. ![Global mean land-ocean temperature change from 1880–2013, relative to the 1951–1980 mean. The black line is the annual mean and the red line is the 5-year running mean.
