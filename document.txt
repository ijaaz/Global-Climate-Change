# Climate Change

## Introduction

Global warming is a clear & present danger to all life on earth. Global warming is destroying a many biospheres as we speak. For some species - including polar bears - extinction is imminent. We are the most significant contributor to global warming.

Global Warming is inevitable, we have missed are largest chance to do anything about it. This is due to our inaction and doubts. Some people also take advantage of global warming.

We have steadily increased global warming through greenhouse gasses & deforestation. We are creating a world where the atmosphere will be dangerous for all life.


## What is Global Warming?

Global Warming is the rise of average temperature around the globe. Global warming is caused mainly by Greenhouse gases. The Greenhouse effect is caused by the absorption & emission of infrared rays, these affect the surface temperature of the planet. 


description: Line plot of global mean land-ocean temperature index, 1880 to present (2013), with the base period 1951-1980. The black line is the annual mean and the red line is the five-year running mean. The green bars show uncertainty estimates. [This is an update of Fig. 1A in Hansen et al. (2006).] The graph shows an overall long-term warming trend. In the 1890s, the global temperature anomaly was on average slightly below -0.3 °C, with an error range of roughly -0.2 and -0.4 °C. In the 1940s, the global temperature anomaly was on average slightly below +0.1 °C, with an error range of roughly 0.0 and +0.15 °C. In the 2000s, the global temperature anomaly was on average slightly below +0.6 °C, with an error range of roughly +0.6 and +0.5 °C.
